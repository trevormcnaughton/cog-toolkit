# Cog React

> ðŸš§ ðŸš§ _Currently in development_ ðŸš§ ðŸš§

A shared set of UI Components and patterns built [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
yarn add git+ssh://git@github.com:trevormcnaughton/cog-toolkit
```

### Basic usage

ðŸ’¼ _Coming soon_

## Adding components with Storybook

We generate a living styleguide with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Run:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:9001`

### Adding stories

If you wish to create your own components add them to `stories/index.js`.

example:

```js
import MyComponent from '../src/components/MyComponent'

storiesOf('My Component', module)
  .add('Default', () => {
    <MyComponent />
  })
```

## Development

### Installation

Clone and install dependencies

```shell
git clone git@github.com:trevormcnaughton/cog-toolkit.git
cd cog-toolkit
yarn
```

### Running locally

```
yarn dev
```

This will watch `src/` and create a `dist/` folder and export the components in a consumable format via `dist/index.js`. It'll watch changes and recompile.

This is good for running as a 'linked' dependency if you want to test in a separate project.
